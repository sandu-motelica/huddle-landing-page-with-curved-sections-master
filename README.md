## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

With Flexbox, arranging elements within containers became a breeze. It made alignment and distribution a snap, adapting seamlessly to different screens. CSS Grid introduced me to two-dimensional layout control, making complex grid creation and responsiveness a cinch. And then there was background positioning â€” a simple yet impactful technique. By combining background images with precise positioning, I learned to create parallax effects, add visual interest, and enhance overall aesthetics.

.bg {
background-size: 100%;
background-repeat: no-repeat;
width: 100%;
height: 22.4rem;
}

.bg-top {
background-position: bottom;
}
.bg-bottom {
background-position: top;
}

.section-1-top {
background-image: url(../images/bg-section-top-desktop-1.svg);
}
.section-1-bottom {
background-image: url(../images/bg-section-bottom-desktop-1.svg);
}

.section-2-top {
background-image: url(../images/bg-section-top-desktop-2.svg);
}
.section-2-bottom {
background-image: url(../images/bg-section-bottom-desktop-2.svg);
}
.footer-top {
background-image: url(../images/bg-footer-top-desktop.svg);
}
